# INDR 501 - Revised Simplex Calculator

This project is developed for Koç University INDR 501 Course Project Assignment.

I implemented Revised Simplex method in accordance with the INDR 501 lecture notes.

The code successfully calculates the correct result for WYNDOR GLASS CO example in the lectures. 

You can press Example button to fill out corresponding parameters for WYNDOR GLASS CO example. Then, you need to press Calcute button to display the results.

I fully implemented the all logic, however I could not find necessary time to add more details to the Solution sections. It displays the necessary information about the steps, but I wanted to fully visualize all steps during the calculation period.
